# How to run mods with mod manager?
After installing all mods, all you have to do is press "Compile Mods" button. Make sure you don't have data_win32 folder in root folder of game.
After compiling, you can start your game!
> [!CAUTION]
> That process cleaning whole game from mods. Make sure you saved all mods which are stored in "ModdingAPI" folder somewhere else.

# Character Roster Editor
This feature will let you change roster as you want. Right window is "Placeholder" for icons, which won't be added in roster. 
This doesn't apply to modded characters. Modded characters will be added at the last page at the last slot if they are in placeholder window.

Use placeholder to drag and drop icons as you want and add it back on pages:

> [!WARNING]
> After Saving your new roster, don't forget to refresh mod list to apply changes for modded characters!
